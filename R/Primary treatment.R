# RX SUMMâ€”SURG PRIM SITE
# NAACCR Item #: 1290
# SEER*Stat Name: RX Summ--Surg Prim Site (1998+) Item Length: 2
# Field Description:
#   Surgery of Primary Site describes a surgical procedure that removes and/or destroys tissue of the primary site performed as part of the initial work-up or first course of therapy.
# The actual coding schemes for individual sites and diagnosis years can be viewed at http://seer.cancer.gov/tools/codingmanuals/historical.html
# General Coding Structure
# Code Description
# 00 
# 10-19
# 20-80 
# 90
# 98
# 99
# 
# None; no surgical procedure of primary site; diagnosed at autopsy only
# Site-specific codes. Tumor destruction; no pathologic specimen or unknown whether there is a pathologic specimen
# Site-specific codes. Resection; pathologic specimen Surgery, NOS. A surgical procedure to the primary site
# was done, but no information on the type of surgical procedure is provided.
# Special codes for hematopoietic, reticuloendothelial, immunoproliferative, myeloproliferative diseases; ill- defined sites; and unknown primaries (See site-specific codes for the sites and histologies), except death certificate only
# Unknown if surgery performed; death certificate only
